## ðŸŽ¨ Design Heuristics Applied

### Edward Tufte Principles

1. **Data-Ink Ratio**: Maximized information density while minimizing visual clutter
2. **Chartjunk Elimination**: Clean charts without unnecessary decorative elements
3. **Small Multiples**: Consistent design patterns across metrics cards and data displays
4. **Layered Information**: Progressive disclosure from summary metrics to detailed holdings

### UX Laws Implemented

1. **Fitts's Law**: Large, easily clickable navigation and action buttons
2. **Miller's Rule**: Information chunked into digestible groups (max 7Â±2 items per section)
3. **Proximity Principle**: Related information grouped visually and spatially
